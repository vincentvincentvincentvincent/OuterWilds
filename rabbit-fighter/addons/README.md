A simple and complete state machine first person controller asset, made in Godot 4.

![Asset logo](https://github.com/Jeh3no/Godot-Simple-State-Machine-First-Person-Controller/blob/main/addons/Arts/Godot%20Simple%20State%20Machine%20First%20Person%20Controller%20-%20Logo.png?raw=true)


# **General**

This asset provides a fully commented, finite state machine based first-person controller with a modular camera system and a debug properties HUD. It is 100% written in GDScript and follows GDScript conventions. My main goal with this project is to provide an easy + complete way to manage and modify a controller for first person games.

A test map is included to demonstrate the controller's capabilities.

The controller uses a finite state machine architecture where each state has its own script, making it straightforward to add, remove, or modify behaviors. All movement parameters, camera settings, and keybindings are exposed as export variables in the inspector for easy customization.


# Compatibility

- **Godot 4.4, 4.5, 4.6**: Fully supported.
- **Godot 4.0 - 4.3**: Should work, but you will need to delete the `.uid` files.


# **Features**

**Movement**
- Finite state machine based controller
- Smooth acceleration and deceleration
- Slope and hill traversal
- Walking
- Crouching (continuous hold or toggle)
- Running (continuous hold or toggle)
- Jumping (configurable multi-jump)
- Jump buffering
- Coyote time
- Air control (customizable via curves)
- Bunny hopping (with optional auto bunny hop)

**Camera**
- Per-state FOV transitions
- Forward and side tilt
- Head bob
- Zoom
- Configurable mouse sensitivity

**UI**
- Crosshair/reticle
- Debug properties HUD
- Input action checker


# Installation / Quickstart

## Step 1: Add the asset to your project

Download or clone this repository and copy the `addons/` folder into your Godot project's root directory.

## Step 2(optional): Set up input actions

The controller requires **9 input actions** to be defined in your project's Input Map. If they are not binded, the default keybindings will be used. Go to **Project > Project Settings > Input Map** and create each of the following actions, then bind them to your preferred keys/buttons.

By default, the key actions are defined as "play_char_{action_name}_action". Do not change this name unless you have configured your own key bindings.

| Input Action Name | Purpose | Default key |
|---|---|---|
| `play_char_move_forward` | Move forward | W, Up |
| `play_char_move_backward` | Move backward | S, Down |
| `play_char_move_left` | Strafe left | A, Left |
| `play_char_move_right` | Strafe right | D, Right |
| `play_char_run` | Run / sprint | Shift |
| `play_char_crouch` | Crouch | C |
| `play_char_jump` | Jump | Space |
| `play_char_zoom` | Camera zoom | Z |
| `play_char_mouse_mode` | Toggle mouse capture | Esc |


# State machine overview

The controller uses 6 states, each in its own script:

| State | Description |
|---|---|
| **Idle** | No movement input. Handles jump buffering and coyote time transitions. |
| **Walk** | Standard movement at base walk speed. |
| **Run** | Faster movement. Supports continuous hold or toggle mode. |
| **Jump** | Active jump with air control. Detects walls for wall run transitions. |
| **InAir** | Airborne without jumping (e.g., walked off an edge). Manages coyote time, jump buffering, and double jumps. |
| **Crouch** | Reduced height and speed. Checks ceiling clearance before standing. |


# Customization

All movement, camera, and state parameters are exposed as export variables in the inspector. Select the `PlayerCharacter` node to find these groups:

- **Movement variables** - Base speed, acceleration, deceleration
- **Crouch variables** - Speed, height, continuous vs. toggle
- **Walk variables** - Speed, acceleration, deceleration
- **Run variables** - Speed, acceleration, deceleration, continuous vs. toggle
- **Jump variables** - Height, time-to-peak, time-to-fall, max jumps, cooldown, coyote time, bunny hop settings
- **Gravity variables** - Calculated automatically from jump parameters

Select the `CameraHolder` node for camera settings:

- **Sensitivity** - X and Y axis mouse sensitivity
- **FOV** - Default and per-state field of view
- **Tilt** - Forward and side camera tilt amounts and speeds
- **Bob** - Head bob pitch, roll, frequency, and height
- **Zoom** - Zoom FOV and transition speed
